### Tell Me About Yourself:
"I am a DevOps Engineer with a strong focus on achieving faster releases with fewer defects through automation. Over the years, I have worked extensively with various tools and technologies that enable me to set up, operate, enhance, and troubleshoot infrastructure and applications in an automated and efficient manner.

I have a solid foundation in **Linux** for system operations and use **Bash scripting** to automate tasks. I work with **AWS** to create infrastructure and deploy applications, leveraging services like **ECS** for container management and **EKS** for Kubernetes orchestration. I utilize **Python** for scripting tasks, especially for automating GitHub repository management and AWS operations.

I manage infrastructure as code with **Terraform**, configure systems using **Ansible**, and create custom AMIs using **Packer**. I also leverage **Docker** to create container images and deploy them across **Kubernetes** clusters. For secure management, I use **HashiCorp Vault** for secret handling.

In terms of CI/CD, I build pipelines with **Jenkins**, **GitHub Actions**, and **GitLab-CI** to automate the deployment of applications. Monitoring and observability are crucial, and I use **Prometheus** for metrics collection, **Grafana** for visualization, and the **Elastic Stack** for logging. For distributed tracing and monitoring service meshes, I use **Jaeger**, **Kiali**, and **Istio**.

I follow a **GitOps** approach using **ArgoCD** to detect and apply changes automatically, ensuring consistent deployments across environments."

### Roles and Responsibilities:
1. **Setup:**
   - Set up and configure **EKS** and **ECS** clusters for container management, ensuring seamless integration with AWS services.
   - Automate infrastructure creation using **Terraform**, and configure environments using **Ansible**.
   - Establish CI/CD pipelines with **Jenkins**, **GitHub Actions**, or **GitLab-CI**, enabling rapid and automated application deployment.
   - Set up **monitoring and logging tools** such as Prometheus, Grafana, and the Elastic Stack to collect system and application metrics.
   - Create **Docker images** and manage containers using **Kubernetes** or ECS, integrating with the broader DevOps pipeline.
   - Automate GitHub repository setups, branch protections, and PR rules using **Python** scripts.

2. **Operations:**
   - Monitor and maintain **EKS/ECS** clusters, ensuring optimal performance and addressing any scaling requirements.
   - Manage **secret handling** with **HashiCorp Vault**, ensuring security best practices.
   - Troubleshoot issues related to infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, container orchestration, and system performance.
   - Perform rolling upgrades and routine maintenance for infrastructure and applications.

3. **Enhancements:**
   - Continuously optimize the setup of **CI/CD pipelines**, reducing build and deployment times.
   - Refactor **Terraform modules** for better reusability and maintainability.
   - Enhance monitoring with additional **Prometheus metrics** and more detailed **Grafana dashboards**.
   - Automate routine tasks, including repository management and infrastructure provisioning, using **Python** and **Bash scripting**.

4. **Troubleshooting:**
   - Resolve issues with deployments, infrastructure failures, and scaling challenges across **EKS/ECS**, **Jenkins**, and **GitOps** workflows.
   - Diagnose problems related to **networking**, **load balancing**, and application failures.
   - Debug performance issues using **monitoring and tracing tools** like Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger, and Kiali.

This structure aligns your expertise with a DevOps Engineer's goals of automation and fast, reliable releases.
